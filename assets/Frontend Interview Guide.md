## Phase 1: JavaScript & TypeScript Fundamentals (15-20 minutes)
*Goal: Ensure strong foundations before diving into frameworks*

### Transition Script
"Great, thanks for sharing that background. Now I'd like to dive into some technical questions. We'll start with JavaScript fundamentals and then work our way up to more complex topics. Remember, I'm interested in your thought process, so please talk through your reasoning."

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 3-4 questions based on candidate level:**
- **Junior**: Focus on questions 1, 2, 3, 9
- **Mid-level**: Focus on questions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
- **Senior**: Focus on questions 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 + TypeScript questions

### Core JavaScript

#### 1. Explain var, let, and const differences. When would you use each?

**Expected Answer:**
- **`var`**: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, hoisted but in temporal dead zone, cannot be redeclared
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, must be initialized, cannot be reassigned (but objects/arrays can be mutated)

**Usage:**
- `const` by default for immutable bindings
- `let` for variables that need reassignment
- `var` rarely used in modern code (legacy support only)

**Follow-up:** Ask about hoisting and temporal dead zone examples.

#### 2. How does JavaScript handle asynchronous code? Explain event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Event Loop**: Single-threaded execution model with call stack, heap, and task queues
- **Macrotasks**: setTimeout, setInterval, I/O operations, UI events
- **Microtasks**: Promises (.then), queueMicrotask(), process.nextTick()
- **Execution Order**: Call stack → Microtasks → Macrotasks → Render

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('1');
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('3'));
console.log('4');
// Output: 1, 4, 3, 2
```

#### 3. What is the difference between == and ===? Why does it matter?

**Expected Answer:**
- **`==`**: Loose equality, performs type coercion
- **`===`**: Strict equality, no type coercion
- **Why it matters**: Prevents unexpected bugs from implicit type conversion

**Examples:**
```javascript
0 == false // true (coercion)
0 === false // false (different types)
'5' == 5 // true (string coerced to number)
'5' === 5 // false (different types)
```

#### 4. Explain closures with a real-world example.

**Expected Answer:**
A closure is when an inner function has access to outer function's variables even after the outer function returns.

**Example:**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

**Real-world uses**: Module patterns, event handlers, partial application

#### 5. What's the difference between map, forEach, filter, and reduce?

**Expected Answer:**
- **`forEach`**: Executes function for each element, returns undefined
- **`map`**: Transforms each element, returns new array
- **`filter`**: Returns new array with elements that pass test
- **`reduce`**: Reduces array to single value using accumulator

**When to use:**
- `forEach`: Side effects, no return needed
- `map`: Transform data 1:1
- `filter`: Subset of data
- `reduce`: Aggregate or complex transformations

#### 6. How would you debounce or throttle a function? When are they useful?

**Expected Answer:**

**Debounce** (delay execution until after calls stop):
```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

**Throttle** (limit execution frequency):
```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function(...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
    }
  };
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Debounce: Search input, form validation
- Throttle: Scroll events, resize events

#### 7. What are ES modules and how do they differ from CommonJS?

**Expected Answer:**

| ES Modules | CommonJS |
|------------|----------|
| `import/export` | `require/module.exports` |
| Static imports | Dynamic imports |
| Tree-shakable | Not tree-shakable |
| Asynchronous loading | Synchronous loading |
| Browser native | Node.js native |

#### 8. Explain promises vs async/await. Which would you prefer and why?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Promises**: `.then()` chains, can become nested
- **Async/await**: Syntactic sugar over promises, more readable

**Preference**: Async/await for most cases due to:
- Better readability
- Easier error handling with try/catch
- No callback hell

**When to use Promises**: Parallel execution with `Promise.all()`

#### 9. What's the difference between null and undefined?

**Expected Answer:**
- **`undefined`**: Variable declared but not assigned, missing object properties
- **`null`**: Intentional absence of value, explicitly set
- **Type**: `undefined` is primitive, `null` is object (historical quirk)

#### 10. Explain immutability. Why is it important in state management?

**Expected Answer:**
Immutability means data cannot be changed after creation. Instead, operations create new data structures.

**Importance:**
- Predictable state changes
- Easier debugging and time-travel debugging
- Performance optimizations (referential equality)
- Prevents accidental mutations

**Techniques:**
```javascript
// Array immutability
const newArray = [...oldArray, newItem];
// Object immutability
const newState = { ...oldState, updatedField: newValue };
```

### TypeScript

#### 1. Difference between type and interface. When would you use each?

**Expected Answer:**

| Type | Interface |
|------|-----------|
| Union types, primitives | Object shapes, classes |
| Cannot be merged | Can be merged |
| Computed properties | Cannot have computed properties |
| More flexible | More extensible |

**Usage:**
- **Type**: Union types, computed properties, utility types
- **Interface**: Object contracts, class implementations, library APIs

#### 2. What are generics? Give an example.

**Expected Answer:**
Generics provide type safety while maintaining flexibility, allowing types to be parameters.

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

// Usage
const stringResult = identity<string>("hello");
const numberResult = identity<number>(42);

// Interface with generics
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: number;
  message: string;
}
```

#### 3. How do you enforce a function to accept only specific string literals?

**Expected Answer:**
Use string literal types:

```typescript
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';

function setTheme(theme: Theme) {
  // Implementation
}

setTheme('light'); // ✅ Valid
setTheme('blue'); // ❌ Type error
```

#### 4. How does TypeScript improve React development compared to plain JS?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Props validation**: Compile-time checking instead of runtime PropTypes
- **IntelliSense**: Better IDE support and autocomplete
- **Refactoring safety**: Rename, move files with confidence
- **Hook type safety**: useCallback, useMemo with proper types
- **Event handling**: Proper event types

#### 5. Explain utility types like Partial<T>, Pick<T>, and Omit<T>.

**Expected Answer:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}

// Partial<T> - makes all properties optional
type PartialUser = Partial<User>; // all props optional

// Pick<T, K> - select specific properties
type UserName = Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>; 

// Omit<T, K> - exclude specific properties
type UserWithoutId = Omit<User, 'id'>;

// Other utility types
type RequiredUser = Required<User>; // all props required
type UserEmail = User['email']; // string
```

## Phase 2: React & State Management (20-25 minutes)
*Goal: Evaluate ability to build scalable, maintainable UI*

### Transition Script
"Great work on the JavaScript fundamentals. Now let's talk about React, which I see you have experience with. I'd like to understand how you approach building components and managing state."

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 3-4 questions based on candidate level:**
- **Junior**: React Basics (1, 2, 3, 4) + Basic Hooks (1, 2)
- **Mid-level**: React Basics (3, 4, 5) + Hooks (2, 3, 4) + Redux (1, 2)
- **Senior**: Advanced React (all) + Redux (3, 4, 5)

### React Basics

#### 1. Difference between functional and class components. Why are hooks preferred?

**Expected Answer:**

**Functional Components:**
- Simpler syntax
- Better performance (no `this` binding)
- Hooks enable state and lifecycle
- Easier testing

**Class Components:**
- Legacy pattern
- More boilerplate
- Complex `this` binding
- Lifecycle methods

**Why Hooks:**
- Reusable stateful logic
- Cleaner code organization
- Better tree shaking
- Future of React

#### 2. Explain props vs state.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Props**: Read-only data passed from parent, immutable within component
- **State**: Component's internal data, can be changed with setState/useState

**Example:**
```jsx
// Props
function Child({ name, age }) {
  return <div>{name} is {age} years old</div>;
}

// State
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <Child name="John" age={count} />;
}
```

#### 3. How does React reconcile UI updates (virtual DOM & reconciliation)?

**Expected Answer:**
1. **Virtual DOM**: JavaScript representation of real DOM
2. **Diffing**: Compare new virtual DOM tree with previous
3. **Reconciliation**: Calculate minimum changes needed
4. **Commit**: Apply changes to real DOM

**Key algorithm**: React Fiber for interruptible, prioritized updates

#### 4. What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?

**Expected Answer:**

**Controlled**: Form data handled by React state
```jsx
function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

**Uncontrolled**: Form data handled by DOM
```jsx
function UncontrolledInput() {
  const ref = useRef();
  const handleSubmit = () => console.log(ref.current.value);
  return <input ref={ref} />;
}
```

#### 5. Explain lifting state up and when it's needed.

**Expected Answer:**
Moving state to closest common ancestor when multiple components need access to same data.

**When needed:**
- Sibling components need to communicate
- Parent needs to control child state
- Multiple components need same data

### Hooks

#### 1. Explain the rules of hooks. Why must they run in the same order?

**Expected Answer:**

**Rules:**
1. Only call hooks at top level (not in loops, conditions, nested functions)
2. Only call hooks from React functions

**Why same order:** React relies on call order to match hooks with their state between renders.

#### 2. Difference between useEffect, useLayoutEffect, and useInsertionEffect.

**Expected Answer:**

| Hook | When it runs | Use case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `useEffect` | After DOM updates, asynchronously | Data fetching, subscriptions |
| `useLayoutEffect` | Before paint, synchronously | DOM measurements, preventing flicker |
| `useInsertionEffect` | Before layout effects | CSS-in-JS libraries |

#### 3. When should you use useMemo and useCallback? Examples.

**Expected Answer:**

**useMemo**: Memoize expensive calculations
```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return expensiveCalculation(data);
}, [data]);
```

**useCallback**: Memoize functions to prevent child re-renders
```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  onClick(id);
}, [onClick, id]);

return <ExpensiveChild onClick={handleClick} />;
```

**When to use**: When profiling shows performance issues, not by default.

#### 4. How would you implement a custom hook? Example: useFetch.

**Expected Answer:**
```jsx
function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}
```

### Advanced React

#### 1. Explain React Server Components (RSC) and how they change the rendering model.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Server Components**: Render on server, don't ship to client
- **Benefits**: Smaller bundle size, server-side data access, better SEO
- **Limitations**: No interactivity, can't use hooks, browser APIs
- **Rendering model**: Hybrid approach with both server and client components

#### 2. Difference between client components and server components in Next.js App Router.

**Expected Answer:**

| Server Components | Client Components |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Default in App Router | Need 'use client' directive |
| Render on server | Render on client |
| Can access server resources | Can use hooks, event handlers |
| No JavaScript to client | JavaScript bundle included |
| Cannot use hooks | Full React features |

#### 3. What is React Suspense? How does it improve UX?

**Expected Answer:**
Suspense lets components wait for data/code loading with fallback UI.

**Benefits:**
- Declarative loading states
- Prevents loading waterfalls
- Better user experience
- Works with lazy loading and data fetching

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

#### 4. Explain hydration in Next.js. What problems can it cause?

**Expected Answer:**
**Hydration**: Process of attaching event listeners to server-rendered HTML.

**Problems:**
- Hydration mismatches (server HTML ≠ client HTML)
- Flash of unstyled content
- Performance issues with large apps
- Client-side only features breaking SSR

**Solutions**: Proper conditional rendering, useEffect for client-only code

### Redux

#### 1. Why use Redux when React has context?

**Expected Answer:**

| Redux | Context |
|-------|---------|
| Predictable state updates | Simple prop passing |
| Time-travel debugging | Built into React |
| Middleware support | Limited functionality |
| Better performance for frequent updates | Can cause unnecessary re-renders |
| DevTools ecosystem | No special tooling |

**When to use Redux**: Complex state logic, frequent updates, large teams

#### 2. Explain store, actions, reducers, and middleware.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Store**: Single source of truth holding app state
- **Actions**: Plain objects describing what happened
- **Reducers**: Pure functions calculating new state
- **Middleware**: Functions that extend store capabilities

#### 3. Show how you would structure Redux slices in a large app.

**Expected Answer:**
```javascript
// userSlice.js
const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState: { profile: null, loading: false },
  reducers: {
    setLoading: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = action.payload;
    },
    setProfile: (state, action) => {
      state.profile = action.payload;
    }
  }
});

// store.js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userSlice.reducer,
    posts: postsSlice.reducer,
    ui: uiSlice.reducer
  }
});
```

#### 4. Difference between Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) and Axios/Fetch.

**Expected Answer:**

| RTK Query | Axios/Fetch |
|-----------|-------------|
| Built-in caching | Manual caching |
| Automatic re-fetching | Manual triggers |
| Loading states managed | Manual state management |
| Optimistic updates | Manual implementation |
| Data normalization | Manual normalization |

#### 5. How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders with Redux?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Selector optimization**: Use `reselect` for memoized selectors
- **Component optimization**: `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`
- **State normalization**: Flat state structure
- **Specific subscriptions**: Connect to specific state slices

## Phase 3: Next.js & API Integration (15-20 minutes)
*Goal: Assess knowledge of modern Next.js 14+ patterns*

### Transition Script
"I see you have Next.js experience. Let's talk about how you approach building applications with Next.js, especially with the newer App Router patterns."

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 3-4 questions based on candidate level:**
- **Junior**: Questions 1, 2, 3, 6 (focus on basics)
- **Mid-level**: Questions 2, 4, 5, 9, 10 (focus on practical usage)
- **Senior**: Questions 7, 8, 10 + system design aspects

#### 1. Explain Server Components vs Client Components.

**Expected Answer:**
**Server Components** (default):
- Render on server
- Access server resources (databases, files)
- Zero JavaScript to client
- Cannot use hooks or event handlers

**Client Components** (`'use client'`):
- Render on client
- Use hooks and event handlers
- Include JavaScript bundle
- Interactive features

#### 2. How does app/ directory differ from pages/ directory?

**Expected Answer:**

| App Router | Pages Router |
|------------|--------------|
| File-based routing with layouts | File-based routing only |
| Server Components by default | Client-side rendering |
| Nested layouts | Single layout per page |
| Loading/error UI co-location | Separate error pages |
| Route groups and parallel routes | Simpler structure |

#### 3. What is static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and ISR? When to use each?

**Expected Answer:**

**SSG (Static Site Generation)**:
- Pre-rendered at build time
- Use for: Blogs, marketing sites, documentation
- Fastest performance

**SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:
- Rendered on each request
- Use for: Personalized content, real-time data
- Dynamic but slower

**ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**:
- Static with periodic updates
- Use for: E-commerce, news sites
- Balance of performance and freshness

#### 4. How do you handle API requests in Next.js 14? Compare fetch, server actions, and API routes.

**Expected Answer:**

**Fetch in Server Components**:
```javascript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}
```

**Server Actions**:
```javascript
async function createUser(formData) {
  'use server';
  // Handle form submission
}
```

**API Routes**: Traditional REST endpoints in `app/api/`

**When to use**:
- Fetch: Data fetching in Server Components
- Server Actions: Form handling, mutations
- API Routes: Third-party integrations, webhooks

#### 5. What are layouts and templates in the App Router?

**Expected Answer:**
**Layouts**: Persistent UI shared across routes, maintain state
**Templates**: Similar to layouts but create new instances

```jsx
// app/dashboard/layout.js
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>Dashboard Nav</nav>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 6. How do you optimize images in Next.js?

**Expected Answer:**
Use `next/image` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority // for LCP optimization
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>
```

**Benefits**: Automatic optimization, lazy loading, responsive images

#### 7. Explain Next.js middleware with an example.

**Expected Answer:**
Middleware runs before request completion:

```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/admin/:path*'
};
```

**Use cases**: Authentication, redirects, header modification

#### 8. How would you implement authentication in Next.js (JWT/session)?

**Expected Answer:**

**JWT Approach**:
```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  const token = request.cookies.get('token');
  if (!token && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/login');
  }
}
```

**Session Approach**: Use libraries like NextAuth.js or iron-session

#### 9. Explain useRouter and redirect in the App Router.

**Expected Answer:**

**useRouter** (Client-side):
```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

const router = useRouter();
router.push('/dashboard');
```

**redirect** (Server-side):
```javascript
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

if (!user) {
  redirect('/login');
}
```

#### 10. How does Next.js handle caching for data fetching?

**Expected Answer:**
Multiple caching layers:
- **Request Memoization**: Dedupe identical requests
- **Data Cache**: Persistent across requests and deployments
- **Full Route Cache**: Static routes cached
- **Router Cache**: Client-side cache

Control with: `revalidate`, `cache`, `next.revalidate`

## Phase 4: Styling & UI (10-15 minutes)
*Goal: Evaluate Tailwind & UI libraries understanding*

### Transition Script
"Let's talk about styling and UI. I see you've worked with [Tailwind/CSS-in-JS/styled-components]. How do you approach styling in modern applications?"

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 2-3 questions based on candidate level and project needs:**
- **Junior**: Tailwind basics (1, 3, 4)
- **Mid-level**: Tailwind (1, 2, 5) + UI Libraries (1, 2)
- **Senior**: All Tailwind + UI Libraries (2, 3)

### Tailwind CSS

#### 1. What are the benefits of using Tailwind over traditional CSS/Sass?

**Expected Answer:**
**Benefits**:
- Utility-first approach reduces CSS bloat
- Consistent design system out of the box
- No naming conflicts
- Better tree-shaking and purging
- Faster development once learned
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Trade-offs**: Learning curve, HTML can look cluttered initially

#### 2. How do you manage design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) in Tailwind?

**Expected Answer:**
Customize `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          50: '#eff6ff',
          500: '#3b82f6',
          900: '#1e3a8a'
        }
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui']
      },
      spacing: {
        '18': '4.5rem'
      }
    }
  }
};
```

#### 3. How do you handle responsive design in Tailwind?

**Expected Answer:**
Mobile-first breakpoint system:

```jsx
<div className="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 xl:w-1/4">
  <h1 className="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
    Responsive Text
  </h1>
</div>
```

**Breakpoints**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)

#### 4. What are dark mode strategies in Tailwind?

**Expected Answer:**

**Class-based strategy**:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class'
};
```

```jsx
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-black dark:text-white">
  Content
</div>
```

**Media query strategy**: `darkMode: 'media'` (system preference)

#### 5. Explain @apply and when not to use it.

**Expected Answer:**
`@apply` lets you extract utility patterns:

```css
.btn-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600;
}
```

**When NOT to use**:
- Defeats utility-first philosophy
- Harder to debug and maintain
- Better to use component abstraction in JS/JSX

### UI Libraries

#### 1. Have you worked with component libraries (shadcn/ui, MUI, Chakra)?

**Expected Answer:**
Compare experiences with:
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-paste components, full customization
- **MUI**: Comprehensive system, Material Design
- **Chakra UI**: Simple, modular, good TypeScript support

**Considerations**: Bundle size, customization needs, design requirements

#### 2. How do you ensure accessibility (a11y) when using pre-built components?

**Expected Answer:**
- Test with screen readers
- Check keyboard navigation
- Verify color contrast ratios
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Test with tools like axe-core

#### 3. How would you override or extend a UI library's styles with Tailwind?

**Expected Answer:**

**Shadcn/ui approach**: Modify source components directly

**Other libraries**: Use CSS-in-JS or CSS modules with higher specificity

```jsx
// With CSS-in-JS
<MuiButton
  sx={{
    '&.MuiButton-root': {
      // Tailwind-like styles
    }
  }}
  className="!bg-blue-500 !text-white"
>
  Button
</MuiButton>
```

## Phase 5: API & Data Layer (10-15 minutes)
*Goal: Assess ability to connect UI with backend*

### Transition Script
"Now let's discuss how you handle data fetching and API integration. This is crucial for building real-world applications."

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 2-3 questions based on candidate level:**
- **Junior**: Questions 1, 3, 6 (focus on basics and security awareness)
- **Mid-level**: Questions 2, 3, 4, 5 (practical implementation)
- **Senior**: Questions 3, 4, 5 (advanced patterns and optimization)

#### 1. Difference between fetch and axios. Pros and cons.

**Expected Answer:**

| Fetch | Axios |
|-------|--------|
| Native browser API | Third-party library |
| Smaller bundle size | More features out of the box |
| Manual JSON parsing | Automatic JSON parsing |
| Basic error handling | Better error handling |
| No request/response interceptors | Built-in interceptors |

**When to use**:
- Fetch: Simple requests, bundle size matters
- Axios: Complex apps, need interceptors, better DX

#### 2. How do you handle request cancellation with Axios or Fetch?

**Expected Answer:**

**Fetch with AbortController**:
```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();

fetch('/api/data', { signal: controller.signal })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Request cancelled');
    }
  });

// Cancel the request
controller.abort();
```

**Axios**:
```javascript
const source = axios.CancelToken.source();

axios.get('/api/data', { cancelToken: source.token })
  .catch(error => {
    if (axios.isCancel(error)) {
      console.log('Request cancelled');
    }
  });

// Cancel the request
source.cancel('Operation cancelled');
```

#### 3. Explain optimistic UI updates. Example with updating a todo list.

**Expected Answer:**
Update UI immediately, rollback if API fails:

```javascript
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

const toggleTodo = async (id) => {
  // Optimistic update
  const updatedTodos = todos.map(todo =>
    todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
  );
  setTodos(updatedTodos);

  try {
    await updateTodoAPI(id, !todos.find(t => t.id === id).completed);
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback on error
    setTodos(todos);
    showErrorMessage('Failed to update todo');
  }
};
```

#### 4. How do you handle global API errors (e.g., unauthorized)?

**Expected Answer:**

**Axios Interceptors**:
```javascript
axios.interceptors.response.use(
  response => response,
  error => {
    if (error.response.status === 401) {
      // Redirect to login
      router.push('/login');
      // Clear auth tokens
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

**React Error Boundary**: For unhandled errors in components

#### 5. How would you paginate data from an API efficiently?

**Expected Answer:**

**Offset-based pagination**:
```javascript
const usePagination = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const loadMore = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch(`/api/data?page=${page}&limit=20`);
    const newData = await response.json();
    setData(prev => [...prev, ...newData]);
    setPage(prev => prev + 1);
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return { data, loadMore, loading };
};
```

**Cursor-based pagination**: Better for real-time data

#### 6. How do you secure API keys in Next.js?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Server-side**: Use environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side)
- **Client-side**: Use proxy API routes to hide keys
- **Never**: Commit keys to version control
- **Production**: Use proper secret management

---

## Phase 6: Git & Collaboration (5-10 minutes)
*Goal: Assess teamwork and version control knowledge*

### Transition Script
"Let's talk about collaboration and version control. How do you typically work with Git in a team environment?"

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 1-2 questions based on candidate level:**
- **All levels**: Questions 1, 2 (fundamental Git knowledge)
- **Mid-level+**: Questions 3, 4, 5 (advanced workflows and team practices)

#### 1. Explain the difference between git merge and git rebase.

**Expected Answer:**

**Git Merge**:
- Creates merge commit
- Preserves commit history
- Shows when branches were merged
- Non-destructive

**Git Rebase**:
- Replays commits on target branch
- Linear history
- No merge commits
- Rewrites commit history

**When to use**:
- Merge: For feature branches, preserving context
- Rebase: For clean linear history, before merging

#### 2. How do you resolve merge conflicts?

**Expected Answer:**
1. `git status` to identify conflicted files
2. Open files, look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Manually resolve conflicts
4. `git add` resolved files
5. `git commit` or continue rebase/merge

**Tools**: VS Code, GitKraken, or command line tools

#### 3. What is GitFlow? When would you use it?

**Expected Answer:**
**GitFlow**: Branching model with specific branch types:
- `main`: Production code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes

**When to use**: Large teams, scheduled releases, need for parallel development

**Alternatives**: GitHub Flow (simpler), GitLab Flow

#### 4. Difference between git reset, git revert, and git checkout.

**Expected Answer:**

| Command | Purpose | History | Safety |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| `git reset` | Undo commits by moving HEAD | Rewrites | Destructive |
| `git revert` | Undo commits by creating new commit | Preserves | Safe |
| `git checkout` | Switch branches or restore files | No change | Safe |

#### 5. How do you squash commits and why?

**Expected Answer:**
**Interactive rebase**:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# Change 'pick' to 'squash' for commits to combine
```

**Why squash**:
- Clean commit history
- Logical units of work
- Easier code review
- Better blame/log readability

---

## Phase 7: System Design & Advanced Scenarios (15-20 minutes)
*Goal: Evaluate ability to architect scalable front-end systems*

### Transition Script
"For this final section, I'd like to explore your approach to system design and architecture. These questions are more open-ended, and I'm looking for your thought process and reasoning."

### Question Selection Strategy
**Choose 1-2 questions based on candidate level:**
- **Junior**: Skip or ask simplified versions focusing on basic application structure
- **Mid-level**: Questions 1, 3, 4 (practical architecture decisions)
- **Senior**: Questions 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 (complex system design and leadership scenarios)

#### 1. How would you structure a large Next.js app with multiple domains (auth, dashboard, settings)?

**Expected Answer:**
```
app/
├── (auth)/
│   ├── login/
│   └── register/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── layout.js
│   ├── page.js
│   └── analytics/
├── settings/
│   ├── layout.js
│   ├── profile/
│   └── billing/
├── api/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── features/
├── lib/
├── hooks/
└── types/
```

**Key principles**:
- Route groups for logical separation
- Shared layouts for consistency
- Feature-based component organization
- Centralized utilities and types

#### 2. Explain how you would handle role-based access control (RBAC) in Next.js.

**Expected Answer:**
**Multi-layered approach**:

1. **Middleware-level** (Route protection):
```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  const token = request.cookies.get('auth-token');
  const userRole = getUserRole(token);
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;

  if (pathname.startsWith('/admin') && userRole !== 'admin') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/unauthorized', request.url));
  }
}
```

2. **Server Component level**:
```jsx
async function AdminDashboard() {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  
  if (!user || user.role !== 'admin') {
    redirect('/unauthorized');
  }
  
  return <AdminContent />;
}
```

3. **Client Component level**:
```jsx
function ProtectedComponent() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (!hasPermission(user, 'READ_ANALYTICS')) {
    return <AccessDenied />;
  }
  
  return <AnalyticsData />;
}
```

4. **API Route protection**:
```javascript
// app/api/admin/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  const user = await authenticateRequest(request);
  
  if (user.role !== 'admin') {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  
  // Admin logic here
}
```

#### 3. How do you design for internationalization (i18n)?

**Expected Answer:**
**Next.js 14 App Router with next-intl**:

1. **Configuration**:
```javascript
// next.config.js
const createNextIntlPlugin = require('next-intl/plugin');
const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

module.exports = withNextIntl({
  // Other config
});
```

2. **Routing structure**:
```
app/
├── [locale]/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── page.js
└── globals.css
```

3. **Translation files**:
```json
// messages/en.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "dashboard": "Dashboard",
    "settings": "Settings"
  },
  "common": {
    "loading": "Loading...",
    "error": "An error occurred"
  }
}
```

4. **Usage in components**:
```jsx
import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';

export default function Dashboard() {
  const t = useTranslations('navigation');
  
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/dashboard">{t('dashboard')}</Link>
      <Link href="/settings">{t('settings')}</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

**Considerations**:
- Right-to-left (RTL) language support
- Date/time formatting
- Number formatting
- Currency localization
- SEO with hreflang tags

#### 4. How do you ensure performance: lazy loading, code splitting, caching?

**Expected Answer:**

**Lazy Loading**:
```jsx
// Component lazy loading
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// Image lazy loading (Next.js default)
<Image src="/large-image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
```

**Code Splitting**:
```jsx
// Route-based splitting (automatic in Next.js)
// Dynamic imports
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./Chart'), {
  loading: () => <ChartSkeleton />,
  ssr: false // Client-only if needed
});

// Vendor splitting in webpack config
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        chunks: 'all',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Caching Strategies**:
```javascript
// Next.js Data Cache
fetch('/api/data', {
  next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour
});

// Browser caching with service worker
// Service worker registration
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');
}

// HTTP caching headers
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json(data, {
    headers: {
      'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400'
    }
  });
}
```

**Performance monitoring**:
```jsx
// Web Vitals tracking
import { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals';

function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  // Send to your analytics service
  gtag('event', metric.name, {
    value: Math.round(metric.value),
    event_label: metric.id
  });
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getFCP(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics);
```

#### 5. How would you implement a design system with Tailwind + shadcn/ui?

**Expected Answer:**

1. **Setup and Configuration**:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js - Design tokens
module.exports = {

      colors: {
        border: 'hsl(var(--border))',
        input: 'hsl(var(--input))',
        ring: 'hsl(var(--ring))',
        background: 'hsl(var(--background))',
        foreground: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
          foreground: 'hsl(var(--primary-foreground))'
        }
      },
      borderRadius: {
        lg: 'var(--radius)',
        md: 'calc(var(--radius) - 2px)',
        sm: 'calc(var(--radius) - 4px)'
      }
    }
  }
};
```

2. **Component Library Structure**:

    └── globals.css   # CSS variables
```

3. **Component Composition**:
```jsx
// components/forms/contact-form.tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
import { Label } from '@/components/ui/label';

export function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <form className="space-y-4">
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
        <Input 
          id="email" 
          type="email" 
          placeholder="Enter your email"
        />
      </div>
      <Button type="submit" className="w-full">
        Submit
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

4. **Theme Management**:
```css
/* styles/globals.css */
@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%;
    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --radius: 0.5rem;
  }

  .dark {
    --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
    --foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%;
    --primary-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  }
}
```

5. **Documentation and Storybook**:

// stories/Button.stories.tsx
export default {
  title: 'UI/Button',
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'A versatile button component with multiple variants.'
      }
    }
  }
};

export const Primary = {
  args: {
    variant: 'default',
    children: 'Primary Button'
  }
};
```

#### 6. Explain trade-offs between client-side rendering (CSR), SSR, and RSC in a SaaS dashboard.

**Expected Answer:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **CSR** | Fast navigation, Rich interactivity, Offline capability | Poor SEO, Slow initial load, SEO challenges | Interactive dashboards, Real-time data |
| **SSR** | Good SEO, Fast initial render, Works without JS | Server load, Complex caching, Hydration issues | Marketing pages, Public content |
| **RSC** | Zero JS bundle, Server data access, Better performance | Limited interactivity, Learning curve, Tooling maturity | Data-heavy pages, SEO-critical content |

**SaaS Dashboard Strategy**:
```jsx
// Hybrid approach
// app/dashboard/layout.js - RSC for navigation
export default async function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  const user = await getCurrentUser(); // Server-side data
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ServerSidebar user={user} /> {/* RSC */}
      <main>
        {children}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

// app/dashboard/analytics/page.js - RSC for initial data
export default async function AnalyticsPage() {
  const initialData = await getAnalyticsData();
  
  return <ClientAnalytics initialData={initialData} />;
}

// ClientAnalytics.jsx - Client component for interactivity
'use client';
export function ClientAnalytics({ initialData }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);
  // Interactive features, real-time updates
  
  return <InteractiveChart data={data} />;
}
```

#### 7. How do you handle SEO in Next.js App Router?

**Expected Answer:**

1. **Metadata API**:
```jsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.js
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.excerpt,
    openGraph: {
      title: post.title,
      description: post.excerpt,
      images: [post.featuredImage],

export default async function sitemap() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  
  const postUrls = posts.map((post) => ({
    url: `https://yoursite.com/blog/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: post.updatedAt,
    changeFrequency: 'monthly',
    priority: 0.8
  }));

  return [
    {
      url: 'https://yoursite.com',
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'yearly',
      priority: 1
    },
    ...postUrls
  ];
}
```

      disallow: ['/admin/', '/api/']
    },
    sitemap: 'https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml'
  };
}
```

#### 8. If you had to migrate a CRA app to Next.js, what steps would you take?

**Expected Answer:**

**Migration Strategy**:

1. **Assessment Phase**:
   - Audit current app structure and dependencies
   - Identify client-side only features
   - Plan for routing changes
   - Assess build and deployment pipeline

2. **Setup Next.js**:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind --eslint
# Copy existing src/ files
# Update package.json dependencies
```

3. **Routing Migration**:
```jsx
// Before: React Router
<Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />

// After: Next.js App Router
// app/dashboard/page.js
export default function DashboardPage() {
  return <Dashboard />;
}
```

4. **State Management**:
```jsx
// Wrap app with providers
// app/layout.js
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ReduxProvider store={store}>
          <AuthProvider>
